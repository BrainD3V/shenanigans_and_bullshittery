# README
This project came into my mind at around 1AM, the main idea is to implement a mini bouncing ball (*) just bouncing in the terminal.
I know how stupid this sounds, but I think that would be good practice for:
- Multi-threaded coding
- Inter-thread communication
- Improve pointers knowledge

As every projects in this repository, this won't have any useful application and I don't expect anyone interacting with it.
Any project in this repository will have two main focus:
1) Improving my coding (mostly C, but maybe even Rust in some point the future)
2) Getting used to use GitHub and, hopefully, becoming a part of the coding community
